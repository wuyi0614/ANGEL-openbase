# ANGEL-openbase

The open knowledge base repository for ANGEL project at NTU. This repository manages all the intermediate scripts and codes for data collection, preprocessing, analyzing, demonstrating, testing and replication, etc. Most operations are maintained in a Python programming context, except for extensive visualization or additional illustration. 

This `openbase` is primarily open for academic purpose and surely it is also established on a wide range of successful and unsuccessful explorations in building up the knowledge base for climate and sustainability science. We sincerely acknowledge the contribution and efforts committed by this work or any other work relevant. We also welcome any suggestions on the `openbase` and collaborations for extensive applications.  

## Configuration

Properly configure your `.env` file before testing the scripts:

```bash
# make sure the `.env` config file is create and the following env variables
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY='sk-****'
```

## TODO

### 1. Data streaming

- [ ] Design and unify the unfinished cleaning job for `IPCC` glossory, scientific statements and original triples
- [ ] Add additional knowledge extractions for statements, and terms

### 2. Knowledge Graph

- [ ] Scoping entities and relationships in a sheet
- [ ] Use LLMs to launch a quick kick-off for entity recognition and searching
